[JOSS submission guide](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

The paper should be in `paper.md`, written in markdown. Citations for in `paper.bib` as they would for `bibtex`. We can check if the paper compiles using [this online tool].

For submission, the paper must be in the same repository as the source code. I think using a seperate repo for the writing process will be easier.
